/** This annotation defines an attribute in open MBean (ManagedObject) or
 * CompositeData (ManagedData).  It is useful in cases where the parent class
 * cannot be annotated (for example, Object.toString(), or a framework class
 * that must be extended
 * but cannot be modified).  The attribute id is defined in the annotation, and
 * it is implemented by the methods inherited by the Managed entity.
 * <p>
 * An example of a use of this is to handle @ManagedData that inherits from
 * Collection<X>, and it is desired to display a read-only attribute containing
 * the elements of the Collection.  Simple add the annotation
 * <p>
 * @InheritedAttribute( methodName="iterator" )
 * <p>
 * to handle this case.  Note that this only supports read-only attributes.
