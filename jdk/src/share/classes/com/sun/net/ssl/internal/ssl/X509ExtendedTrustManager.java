 * Instance of this class is an extension of <code>X509TrustManager</code>.
 * <p>
 * Note that this class is referenced by the Deploy workspace. Any updates
 * must make sure that they do not cause any breakage there.
 * <p>
 * It takes the responsiblity of checking the peer identity with its
 * principal declared in the cerificate.
 * <p>
 * The class provides an alternative to <code>HostnameVerifer</code>.
 * If application customizes its <code>HostnameVerifer</code> for
 * <code>HttpsURLConnection</code>, the peer identity will be checked
 * by the customized <code>HostnameVerifer</code>; otherwise, it will
 * be checked by the extended trust manager.
 * <p>
 * RFC2830 defines the server identification specification for "LDAP"
 * algorithm. RFC2818 defines both the server identification and the
 * client identification specification for "HTTPS" algorithm.
