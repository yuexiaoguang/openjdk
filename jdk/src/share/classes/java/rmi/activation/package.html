Provides support for RMI Object Activation.  A remote
object's reference can be made ``persistent'' and later activated into a
``live'' object using the RMI activation mechanism.

<p>Implementations are not required to support the activation
mechanism. If activation is not supported by this implementation,
several specific activation API methods are all required to throw
{@code UnsupportedOperationException}. If activation is supported by this
implementation, these methods must never throw {@code
UnsupportedOperationException}. These methods are denoted by the
presence of an entry for {@code UnsupportedOperationException} in the
<strong>Throws</strong> section of each method's specification.
