Provides classes and interfaces for supporting the server
side of RMI.  A group of classes are used by the stubs and skeletons
generated by the rmic stub compiler.  Another group of classes
implements the RMI Transport protocol and HTTP tunneling.

<p><strong>Deprecated: HTTP Tunneling.</strong> <em>The HTTP tunneling
mechanism has been deprecated. See {@link java.rmi.server.RMISocketFactory} for
further information.</em>

<p><strong>Deprecated: Skeletons and Static Stubs.</strong>

<em>Skeletons and statically generated stubs are deprecated.  This
includes the APIs in this package that require the use of skeletons
or static stubs, the runtime support for them, and the use of the
{@code rmic} stub compiler to generate them.  Support for skeletons
and static stubs may be removed in a future release of the
platform. Skeletons are unnecessary, as server-side method dispatching
is handled directly by the RMI runtime. Statically generated stubs are
unnecessary, as stubs are generated dynamically using {@link
java.lang.reflect.Proxy Proxy} objects. See {@link
java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject UnicastRemoteObject} for
information about dynamic stub generation. Generation of skeletons and
static stubs was typically performed as part of an application's build
process by calling the {@code rmic} tool. This is unnecessary, and
calls to {@code rmic} can simply be omitted.</em>
