Classes for matching character sequences against patterns specified by regular
expressions.

<p> An instance of the {@link java.util.regex.Pattern} class represents a
regular expression that is specified in string form in a syntax similar to
that used by Perl.

<p> Instances of the {@link java.util.regex.Matcher} class are used to match
character sequences against a given pattern.  Input is provided to matchers via
the {@link java.lang.CharSequence} interface in order to support matching
against characters from a wide variety of input sources. </p>

<p> Unless otherwise noted, passing a <tt>null</tt> argument to a method
in any class or interface in this package will cause a
{@link java.lang.NullPointerException NullPointerException} to be thrown.
