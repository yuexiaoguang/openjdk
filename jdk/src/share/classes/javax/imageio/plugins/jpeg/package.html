Classes supporting the built-in JPEG plug-in.

<P>

This package contains some support classes for the built-in JPEG
reader and writer plug-ins.  Classes are provided for representing
quantization and Huffman tables, and extensions of
<code>ImageReadParam</code> and <code>ImageWriteParam</code> are
provided to supply tables during the reading and writing process.  For
more information about the operation of the built-in JPEG plug-ins,
see the <A HREF="../../metadata/doc-files/jpeg_metadata.html">JPEG
metadata format specification and usage notes</A>.
