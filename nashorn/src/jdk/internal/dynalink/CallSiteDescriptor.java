/**
 * An immutable descriptor of a call site. It is an immutable object that contains all the information about a call
 * site: the class performing the lookups, the name of the method being invoked, and the method signature. The library
 * has a default {@link CallSiteDescriptorFactory} for descriptors that you can use, or you can create your own
 * descriptor classes, especially if you need to add further information (values passed in additional parameters to the
 * bootstrap method) to them. Call site descriptors are used in this library in place of passing a real call site to
 * guarding linkers so they aren't tempted to directly manipulate the call sites. The constructors of built-in
 * {@link RelinkableCallSite} implementations all need a call site descriptor. Even if you create your own call site
 * descriptors consider using {@link CallSiteDescriptorFactory#tokenizeName(String)} in your implementation.
