      Contains the main API for using the dynamic linking facilities. A
      scripting framework or a language runtime that does not define its own
      linker but only uses linkers available in the system will only need to
      use classes and interfaces from this package.
    </p>
    <p>
      Languages that wish to define and use their own linkers will also need to
      use the {@link jdk.internal.dynalink.linker} package.
